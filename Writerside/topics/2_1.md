# 2.1 Writing a Simple Program

## Program: Printing a Pun

<code-block lang="c" src="pun.c"/>


## Compiling and Linking

Three steps:
1. Preprocessing -  the **preprocessor** obeys commands that begin with `#` (known as *directives*)
2. Compiling - the **compiler** translates the program into machine instructions (object code)
3. Linking - the **linker** combines object code with any additional code needed i.e. code libraries(like `printf`)
